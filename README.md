# Youtube 2023 Continent Statistics

## Context
In my YouTube 2023 Statistics project, I analyzed global trends and content performance using a Kaggle dataset. Focusing on metrics like views, subscribers, and engagement rates, I uncovered insights into what drives success on the platform. To showcase my data analytics skills, I used tools like Excel, Power BI, and SQL, handling data cleaning, visualization, and analysis without Python. This project highlights my ability to identify patterns, uncover growth opportunities, and present actionable insights. It reflects my capacity to transform raw data into meaningful narratives, aligning with the key responsibilities of a data analyst in decision-making.
